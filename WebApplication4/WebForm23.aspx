            <p>It is also possible to move the vertical scrollbar to the left side of the Panel control by using the Direction attribute. Direction can be set to NotSet, LeftToRight, and RightToLeft. A setting of RightToLeft is ideal when you are dealing with languages that are written from right to left (some Asian languages, for example). However, that setting also moves the scrollbar to the left side of the Panel control. If the scrollbar is moved to the left side and the HorizontalAlign attribute is set to Left, your content resembles Figure 5-30.</p>
